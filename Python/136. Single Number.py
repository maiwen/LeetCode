Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Bit Manipulation
Concept

If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
a \oplus 0 = aa⊕0=a
If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0
a \oplus a = 0a⊕a=0
a \oplus b \oplus a = (a \oplus a) \oplus b = 0 \oplus b = ba⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b
So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.
